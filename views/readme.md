# views

This is where all your HTML templating engine files should go. Create a single
directory for a set of HTML templates for an single entity. For example for all
HTML templates for shops should go in `./shops/` (e.g. `./shops/shop.hbs` for
the page that renders a single shop).

# Template Handlebars View

see the `./template` directory for a sample set of views to use. Feel free to
copy this directory to create your own set of views.
