# controllers 

This directory is for your HTTP request response handlers. Everything to
do with a specific endpoint for your website should go in its own file. For example
all request handlers that start with `shops/` should go in `./shops.js`.

# Template Controller File

See the `./template.js` file for a template controller file. Feel free to copy `template.js`
when creating new controllers and complete all steps labeled `TODO`
